== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]
|=========================================================
|Priority | Risk | Explanation | Solution

|1
| SOLID
| No one on the team has ever used SOLID, so we all lack knowledge of this framework.
| Read more articles related to this topic or see a guide.

|2
| REACT
| No one has experience with REACT, although all team members already know JavaScript.
| Adapt knowledge of JavaScript to TypeScript.

|3
| Docker
| We haven't focused on this yet (beyond its installation), however we also lack knowledge of how it is used.
| Understand how it works even in a basic way.

|4
| MongoDB
| We have never worked with this particular database but all members have already used a non-relational one.
| Understand how it works by looking at documentation about it.

|5
| GitHub
| Although the entire team works well with GitHub, there is a lack of ease when performing certain actions.
| This is not a big inconvenience, it will be resolved as problems arise.
